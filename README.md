# 3D Icosahedron with Three.js

This project demonstrates how to create and animate a 3D icosahedron using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). It includes basic 3D rendering, orbit controls for user interaction, and both solid and wireframe versions of the geometry.

## Features

- **3D Rendering with Three.js**: A WebGL-powered renderer for efficient and smooth rendering.
- **Interactive Orbit Controls**: Allows users to rotate and zoom around the scene.
- **Icosahedron Geometry**: A 20-faced polyhedron rendered with flat shading.
- **Wireframe Overlay**: Adds a wireframe mesh on top of the solid geometry for better visual effects.
- **Hemispherical Lighting**: Simulates natural lighting from the sky and ground.
- **Animation Loop**: Continuously animates the icosahedron with a smooth rotation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/threejs-intro.git

2. To test the project locally after installing Node.js and Three.js:

  1. Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
   
  2. Install Three.js via npm:
     ```bash
     npm install three


## Testing

To test the project locally:

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
2. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
3. Use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code:
   - Right-click on `index.html` in the file explorer and select **Open with Live Server**.
   - The project will automatically open in your default browser at a local server URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5500`).
   
4. You should see the 3D scene with the rotating icosahedron. Use your mouse to rotate and zoom using the orbit controls.
